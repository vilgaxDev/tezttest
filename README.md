# React Interview Challenge

## Description

This project is designed to test your knowledge of front-end web technologies and assess your ability to create front-end UI products with attention to detail, cross-browser compatibility, standards, and reusability.


## Assignment

The goal of this exercise is to create a demo calendar application using React.

You are provided a base application with a calendar page at `/calendar`. You must allow the user to create "reminder" cards, as described in the Mandatory features section.

## Mandatory features
 - Ability to add "*reminders*" (max. 30 characters) for a day and time specified by the user.
 - Ability to include a city as a location for the reminder.
 - Ability to edit reminders - including changing text, city, day, and time.
 - Add a weather service call from [VisualCrossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services#) and get the average temperature forecast (e.g. 15Â° C) for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city.
 - Change the weekend days cells' color

## Bonus (Optional)

- Properly handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.
- Unit test the functionality: *Ability to add "*reminders*" (max. 30 characters) for a day and time specified by the user.*

## Considerations

 - Show us in the Readme all relevant information about your project.
 - The project is completely focused on Front-end. Ignore the Back-end.
 - Feel free to use small helper libraries for:
 -- UI Elements.
 -- Date/Time handling.
 - We have implemented Redux thunk for state management, but you may use any state manager you are familiar with.
 - Show us your capabilities in CSS and styling, if possible.
 - Feel free to use Typescript if you prefer it

# How to deploy

 - Run `npm install` | `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
 - Run `npm start`   | `yarn run` to run the app locally.
 - You can find the project running on `localhost:3000`.
